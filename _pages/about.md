I am a Senior Research Scientist in Motion Planning and Prediction at [FiveAI]. My current research focus is Online Interactive Planning for Autonomous Vehicles. The methods that I am working on must also handle a large degree of uncertainty and limit the amount of risk given the safety critical nature of the application. Previously, I have completed a PhD within the [ILCC] institute of the [School of Informatics] at the [University of Edinburgh] under the supervision of [Alex Lascarides] and [Subramanian Ramamoorthy].

### Research interests

- *Machine Learning*: Planning and Decision Making, Reinforcement Learning, Deep Neural
